# Learning python TDD

# Context

* This repository aims to represent some basic TDD (Test Driven Development) in python for general purpose.

# Tools used

* Python 3.9 on ubuntu subsystem in windows 10
* Tests in [GIVEN, WHEN, THEN](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html)

# Testing procedure

## Available solutions

So far, I have seen different solutions.
* `pytest` seems to be some widely spread and complete solution :
  * It uses functions to test

* `unittest` seems to be a simplest and more readable solution
  * It uses Classes to test

* `nosetest` seems to be really simple to implement for begginers

* Some are even mixing unittest and nose tests to get even further
## Set up the testing environment

* `pip install pytest`
Write your test
